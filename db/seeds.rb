            lyrics: "Come fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away\nIf you can use some exotic booze\nThere's a bar in far Bombay\nCome on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away\nCome fly with me, will float down to Peru\nIn llama-land there's a one-man band\nAnd he'll toot his flute for you\nCome on fly with me, we'll float down in the blue\nOnce I get you up there\nWhere the air is rarefied\nWe'll just glide\nStarry-eyed\nOnce I get you up there\nI'll be holding you so near\nYou might hear\nAll the angels cheer because we're together\nWeather-wise, it's such a lovely day\nJust say those words and we'll feed those birds\nDown to Acapulco Bay\nIt is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say\nCome on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away, we'll fly\nOnce I get you up there\nWhere the air is so rarefied\nWe'll gonna glide\nAbsolutely petrified\nOnce I get you up there\nI'll be holding you so awfully near\nYou might even hear\nA gang of angels cheer just because we're together\nWeather-wise, it's such a groovy day\nYou just say that words and I'll beat the birds\nDown to Acapulco Bay\nIt's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they do say\nCome on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly\nPack up let's fly away",

            lyrics: "I get no kick from champagne\nMere alcohol, it doesn't move me at all\nSo tell me why should it be true\nThat I get a kick out of you\nSome like the bop-type refrain\nI'm sure that if I heard even one riff\nT'would bore me terrifically too\nYeah, I get a kick out of you\nI get a kick every time I see you\nStanding there before me\nI get a kick though it's clear to me\nYou obviously don't adore me\nI get no kick in a plane\nFlying too high with some gal in the sky\nIs my idea of nothing to do\nYeah, I get a kick out of you\nI get a kick every time I see you\nStanding there before me\nI get a kick though it's clear to me\nYou obviously do don't adore me\nI get no kick in a plane\nFlying too high with some gal in the sky\nIs my idea of nothing to do\nYeah, I get a kick, yes, I get a kick yes, I get a kick out of you",
